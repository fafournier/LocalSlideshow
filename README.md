# LocalSlideshow

LocalSlideshow is a single html static file that allows you to specify a local folder and it display a slideshow of the pictures in this folder and any sub-folder.

There's not many bells or whisles. This was just a little experiment to build the most lightweight tool for this without using external dependencies.

Pull requests to improve or add functionalities are welcome.
