    <h1>Local Slideshow</h1>
    <p>LocalSlideshow is a single html static file that allows you to specify a local folder and it display a slideshow of the pictures in this folder and any sub-folder. Nothing is uploaded to any server. Everything is kept locally in your browser. This works offline if you save the page first.</p>
    <p>There's not many bells or whisles. This was just a little experiment to build the most lightweight tool for this without using external dependencies.</p>
    <p>Pull requests to improve or add functionalities are welcome.</p>
    <p>One of the main missing thing is a loading indicator while the browser reads the folders. I tested with 21k files in 200+ sub-folders. It works but takes a good few minutes to reach loading the first image.</p>

    <p>This tool is part of the <a href="https://microtools.francoisfournier.eu/MicroTools/">F² MicroTools suite</a>. A collection of tools that that are tiny, with no dependencies and typically just do one thing.</p>
